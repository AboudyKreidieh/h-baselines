class MultiActorCriticPolicy(ActorCriticPolicy):
    """Multi-agent base actor critic policy.

    This policy supports training off-policy variants of three popular
    multi-agent algorithms:

    * Independent learners: Independent (or Naive) learners provide a separate
      policy with independent parameters to each agent in an environment.
      Within this setting, agents are provided separate observations and reward
      signals, and store their samples and perform updates separately. A review
      of independent learners in reinforcement learning can be found here:
      https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00720669/document

      To train a policy using independent learners, do not modify any
      policy-specific attributes:

      >>> from hbaselines.algorithms.off_policy import OffPolicyRLAlgorithm
      >>>
      >>> alg = OffPolicyRLAlgorithm(
      >>>     policy=MultiActorCriticPolicy,
      >>>     env="...",  # replace with an appropriate environment
      >>>     policy_kwargs={}
      >>> )

    * Shared policies: Unlike the independent learners formulation, shared
      policies utilize a single policy with shared parameters for all agents
      within the network. Moreover, the samples experienced by all agents are
      stored within one unified replay buffer. See the following link for an
      early review of the benefit of shared policies:
      https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.8066&rep=rep1&type=pdf

      To train a policy using the shared policy feature, set the `shared`
      attribute to True:

      >>> from hbaselines.algorithms.off_policy import OffPolicyRLAlgorithm
      >>>
      >>> alg = OffPolicyRLAlgorithm(
      >>>     policy=MultiActorCriticPolicy,
      >>>     env="...",  # replace with an appropriate environment
      >>>     policy_kwargs={
      >>>         "shared": True,
      >>>     }
      >>> )

    * MADDPG: We implement algorithmic-variants of MAPPG for all supported
      off-policy RL algorithms. See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf

      To train a policy using their MADDPG variants as opposed to independent
      learners, algorithm, set the `maddpg` attribute to True:

      >>> from hbaselines.algorithms.off_policy import OffPolicyRLAlgorithm
      >>>
      >>> alg = OffPolicyRLAlgorithm(
      >>>     policy=MultiActorCriticPolicy,
      >>>     env="...",  # replace with an appropriate environment
      >>>     policy_kwargs={
      >>>         "maddpg": True,
      >>>         "shared": False,  # or True
      >>>     }
      >>> )

      This works for both shared and non-shared policies. For shared policies,
      we use a single centralized value function instead of a value function
      for each agent.
