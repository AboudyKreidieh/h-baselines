class GoalConditionedPolicy(ActorCriticPolicy):
    r"""Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning model.

    This policy is an implementation of the two-level hierarchy presented
    in [1], which itself is similar to the feudal networks formulation [2, 3].
    This network consists of a high-level, or Manager, pi_{\theta_H} that
    computes and outputs goals g_t ~ pi_{\theta_H}(s_t, h) every `meta_period`
    time steps, and a low-level policy pi_{\theta_L} that takes as inputs the
    current state and the assigned goals and attempts to perform an action
    a_t ~ pi_{\theta_L}(s_t,g_t) that satisfies these goals.

    The Manager is rewarded based on the original environment reward function:
    r_H = r(s,a;h).

    The Target term, h, parameterizes the reward assigned to the Manager in
    order to allow the policy to generalize to several goals within a task, a
    technique that was first proposed by [4].

    Finally, the Worker is motivated to follow the goals set by the Manager via
    an intrinsic reward based on the distance between the current observation
    and the goal observation:
    r_L (s_t, g_t, s_{t+1}) = -||s_t + g_t - s_{t+1}||_2
