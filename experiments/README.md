# Benchmarking HRL Models and Algorithms

We provide a sequence of runner and evaluation scripts to validate the 
performance of the various algorithms provided within this repository. The 
environments that are currently supported for training can be found 
[here](https://github.com/AboudyKreidieh/h-baselines#3-environments). If you 
would like to test these algorithms on custom environments, refer to this 
[section](#3-training-on-custom-environments) on incorporating custom 
environments.

## 1. Running Existing Models and Algorithms

These are three existing models, using policies: the feed-forward policy, the
goal-conditioned policy, and the multi-agent feed-forward policy.

To run these models, use command:
```shell script
python MODEL.py ENV_NAME
```
with `run_fcnet.py` for feed-forward policy, `run_hrl.py` for goal-conditioned
policy, `run_multi_fcnet.py` for multi-agent feed-forward policy in place of
`MODEL.py`.

The following optional command-line arguments may be passed in to adjust the
choice of algorithm:

* `--alg` (*str*): The algorithm to use. Must be one of [TD3, SAC]. Defaults to
  'TD3'.

  evaluation environment is similar to the training environment, but with 
  `env_params.evaluate` set to True.

  training operation is performed on a new seed. Defaults to 1.
* `--total_steps` (*int*): Total number of timesteps used during training.

  environment before the model is saved. Defaults to 50000.
* `--initial_exploration_steps` (*int*): number of timesteps that the policy is
  run before training to initialize the replay buffer with samples. Defaults to
  10000.

The following optional command-line arguments may be passed in to adjust
variable hyperparameters of the algorithms:

## 2. Visualizing Pre-trained Results

### 2.1 Plotting Learning Curves

Results from a sequence of completed training operations using the following 
command:

```shell script
python plot.py FOLDERS
```

The method take as a required input the path to where the model/algorithm 
results are located. The results from each unique model/algorithm must be 
separated by a folder. For example, if you were to have two results when 
utilizing TD3, and one when utilizing SAC, the file structure should look 
something similar to the following:

```
experiments -----|
                 |
                 |------ plot.py
                 |
                 |------ TD3
                 |        |--- 0
                 |        |    |--- train.csv
                 |        |
                 |        |--- 1
                 |             |--- train.csv
                 |
                 |------ SAC
                          |--- 0
                               |--- train.csv
```

The command under this situation may be filled as follows:

```shell script
python plot.py "TD3" "SAC"
```

Additional command-line arguments are:

* `--names` (*list of str*) : The names to be assigned for each result. Must be
  equal in size to the number of folder specified. If not assigned, no legend 
  is added.
* `--out` (*str*) : the path where the figure should be saved. Append with a 
  .svg file if you would like to generate SVG formatted graphs.
* `--use_eval` (*store_true*) : whether to use the eval_*.csv or train.csv 
  files to generate the plots
* `--y` (*str*) : the column to use for the y-coordinates
* `--x` (*str*) : the column to use for the x-coordinates
* `--ylabel` (*str*) : the label to use for the y-axis. If set to None, the 
  name of the column used for the y-coordinates is used.
* `--xlabel` (*str*) : the label to use for the x-axis. If set to None, the 
  name of the column used for the x-coordinates is used.
* `--show` (*store_true*) : whether to show the figure that was saved

### 2.2 Visualizing Pr-trained Models

An evaluator script is written to run evaluation episodes of a given checkpoint
using pre-trained policies. Run with the following command:

```shell script
python run_eval.py DIR_NAME
```
with `DIR_NAME` as path to the checkpoints folder.

Some optional arguments to be passed in are:
* `--ckpt_num` (*int*): the checkpoint number. If not specified, the last
  checkpoint is used.
* `--num_rollouts` (*int*): the number of eval episodes. Defaults to 1.
* `--no_render` (*store_true*): shuts off rendering.
* `--random_seed` (*store_true*): whether to run the simulation on a random 
  seed. If not added, the original seed is used.

## 3. Training on Custom Environments

In addition to typical environments registered within `gym` or provided by the
Flow examples folder, any gym-compatible environment can be made to run via 
the above commands. In order to include support for custom environments, you 
will need to add said environment to the `ENV_ATTRIBUTES` dictionary object 
located in 
[hbaselines/utils/env_util.py](https://github.com/AboudyKreidieh/h-baselines/blob/master/hbaselines/utils/env_util.py).
Via this dict, new environments can be specified as individual elements whose
keys represents the name of the environment when being run. For example, if you
would like to incorporate a new environment called "myEnv", the environment 
would be included to this dict as follows:

```python
ENV_ATTRIBUTES = {
    # do not delete existing environments
    # ...
    # create a new environment named "myEnv"
    "myEnv": {
        "meta_ac_space": None,
        "state_indices": None,
        "env": None,
    },
}
```

The components of any key within the dictionary are used to specify the method
for instantiating and returning the environment, as well as the indices within
the observation that are assigned goals by meta-policies and the bounds of 
these goals. This is broken down into three subcategories, defined as follows:

* **meta_ac_space:** a lambda function that takes an input whether the higher 
  level policies are assigning relative goals and returns the action space of 
  the higher level policies
* **state_indices:** a list that assigns the indices that correspond to goals 
  in the Worker's state space
* **env:** a lambda term that takes an input (evaluate, render, multiagent, 
  shared, maddpg) and return an environment or list of environments

For example, taking the AntGather environment located within the original 
dictionary as an example, and described within the main directory's README, the
inclusion of said environment via the "myEnv" key can be performed as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from gym.spaces import Box
from hbaselines.envs.snn4hrl.envs import AntGatherEnv
ENV_ATTRIBUTES = {
    # do not delete existing environments
    # ...
    # create a new environment named "myEnv"
    "myEnv": {
        "meta_ac_space": lambda relative_goals: Box(
            low=np.array([-10, -10, -0.5, -1, -1, -1, -1, -0.5, -0.3, -0.5,
                          -0.3, -0.5, -0.3, -0.5, -0.3]),
            high=np.array([10, 10, 0.5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.3, 0.5,
                           0.3, 0.5, 0.3]),
            dtype=np.float32,
        ),
        "state_indices": [i for i in range(15)],
        "env": lambda evaluate, render, multiagent, shared, maddpg:
        AntGatherEnv(),
    },
}
```

Finally, the environment can now be run by any of the commands provided within
this file. For example, if you would like to train "myEnv" with a fcnet TD3 
policy, run the following command:

```shell script
python run_fcnet.py "myEnv"
```
