# h-baselines


## 1. Introduction

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has been receiving increasing 
interest by the machine learning community over the past few years. Fueled by 
the need for models that can handle the difficulty associated with solving 
large, multi-modal, and often sparse reward problems, hierarchically structured 
neural network models have served a significant role in bridging this perceived 
gap.

While HRL models and algorithms do seem like a promising solution to some of 
the most complex sequential decision-making problems to date, the comparative 
performance of many of these algorithms with respect to one another has widely 
been ignored, with most of the state-of-the-art implementations comparing their 
results to simple feedforward (cite) or recurrent neural networks trained () 
on similar algorithms (1, 2, 3), or on algorithms that support exploration via 
augmentations to the reward space (VIM), while essentially ignoring their most 
competitive adverseries, the other HRL models they are meant to beat on the 
tasks they are trying to solve.

This repository attempts to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 
comparative many of these hierarchical models and algorithms by providing a 
unified playground through which they can be compared with one another. In 
order to do so, **blank**.
